# LogAnalysis

this small project requires me to utilize vagrant and virtualbox to analize a postgresql database.  
the questions are:
 1) What are the most popular three articles of all time?
 2) Who are the most popular article authors of all time?
 3) On which days did more than 1% of requests lead to errors?

# requirements
install virtualbox and vagrant 
upload newsdata.sql in vagrant virtual machine

the classes are named based on the questions they are meant to answer.
